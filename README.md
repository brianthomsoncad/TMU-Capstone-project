ANALYZING CREDIT RISK ASSESSMENT USING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS: IMPLICATIONS IN AN ERA OF ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY

Overview:
This repository serves as a comprehensive record of the Credit Risk Assessment Capstone Project. The project aims to analyze and develop predictive models for credit risk assessment, using various machine learning algorithms. The project encompasses multiple phases, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

Project Stages: the project is organized into the following key stages:

1. Data Acquisition
- Obtain the Credit Risk Dataset from Kaggle.
- Review the dataset's structure and contents.

2. Data Exploration
- Perform initial data exploration to understand the dataset.
- Identify key variables and their significance in credit risk assessment.

3. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- Handle missing data and outliers.
- Create new features for income groups, loan amount groups, and loan-to-income ratio.

4. Data Processing and Encoding
- Prepare the dataset for modeling by encoding categorical variables.
- Scale the data to ensure model compatibility.

5. Model Selection
- Consider various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and SVM.
- Implement each algorithm to evaluate their performance in credit risk assessment.

6. Model Evaluation
- Employ evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Use cross-validation to ensure robust experimental design.

7. Analyzing Research Questions and Literature Review Relevance
- Address the research questions posed in the project.
- Compare and contrast the results of different algorithms to draw conclusions.
- Refer to the literature review to understand how previous research aligns with the project's findings and methodologies.

8. Result intepretation and presentation
